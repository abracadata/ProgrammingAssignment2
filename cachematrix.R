## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do
# The function makeCacheMatrix(x = matrix()) creates a matrix object that can
# cache its own inverse.  

## Write a short comment describing this function
# This function creates a matrix object and its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  print("Homework not finished.")
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
# This function looks to see if an object created with makeCacheMatrix()
# has its inverse stored; if not, it calculates the inverse matrix and stores
# that.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        #nothing to see here yet.
}
